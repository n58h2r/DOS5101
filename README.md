DOS5101: Supply Chain Coordination and Risk Management
Guide to Simulation Game
Overview
• The objective of the game is to come up with a coherent supply chain strategy that incorporates overall planning and risk management, and helps the company to maximize its operating profits in the long-run
• Involves the use of excel spreadsheet
• Players play for 6 rounds, with each round representing a year
• First year will be the same decision for all teams, so you are effectively making decisions for 5 years (= 5 rounds)
Game Rules
• There is a set of management decisions to choose from
• Every year, each team will select 3 decisions / actions
• Results of the decisions / actions are to be updated into the spreadsheet template
• The 3 actions in each year must be different – meaning that you cannot take one action and do the same thing twice within the same year
• Some actions are mutually exclusive in the same year
• At the end of each round, facilitator will draw an event card, which may have certain effects on the next round
• No action should be taken more than three (3) times in the five years from Year 2 to Year 6
• Results will usually take place in the next year, but some actions have a delayed result, such as RD, investment, etc where expenditures come first, but results come later
Simulation Game
• Simulation game will take place over 4 weeks (please note it will be very compressed!)
• We will start with a baseline for every group
• Each group expected to make management decisions for every quarter, choosing from a list of actions / decisions to be taken
• Each management decision / action will result in certain costs and revenue impacts, which are known
• Every “cycle” of the game, we will draw a card / spin a wheel which will introduce some macroeconomic event
• We will tabulate the financial results of the groups after every cycle of operation and circulate this on the class website
• Top teams receive prizes
Using the financial template
• Formulas are already linked
• The key is to make changes in the cells by multiplying by percentage changes
• There is a base spreadsheet which is locked. This is your comparison spreadsheet in case you make changes and forget what you did. You can go back to compare to the original
• Starting base year is year 0
• Actions are to be taken on Year 1. In case of delayed effects (example in RD), the delayed effect on sales will happen in Year 2. Similarly, if the RD代 写DOS5101: Supply Chain Coordination and Risk ManagementWeb
代做程序编程语言 action is taken in Year 2, increase RD cost will occur in Year 2 but sales increase will happen in Year 3
• Whatever action is taken, the effect will continue into future years
• Actions are non-sequential for the particular year – example, whatever 3 actions are taken, all the effects on the PL are added together and key into Year 1
• Example, if action 1 increases sales by 5% and action 2 decreases sales by 3% and decreases logistics cost by 5%, the net effect on year 1 is based on: Year 0 X 1.02 for sales and Year 0 X 0.95 for logistics cost
• For Year 1, all groups will take the same actions so you should all get the same result
Macroeconomic event (Exploding Kittens!)
• At end of every year, event will be drawn
• Event cards describe certain events that cause impact to your supply chain. Typical events include events such as – epidemics, new sales opportunities, new competitor products are introduced, etc
• Each event has a certain probability of happening and certain impact depending on what actions you took
• There will be impacts to revenue or cost. These impacts could be positive or negative depending on what actions you took
• Events will impact actions which are taken in previous years as well
Wheel of fortune
Impact of event
• Once the event card is drawn, any impact on your financial statement is made in Year + 1 together with the rest of your actions
• Example if you are playing Year 1, and sales reduce by 5% through the Event, and you take an action that increase sales by 7%, year 2 sales = year 1 * 1.02 in Year 2
• This is done before you start the rest of your actions for Year 2
• Actions + Event impact is additive
Simulation game report
• Each group to keep track of their decisions every cycle
• Management Report -- 12 to 18 pages, excluding appendices
• Diagrams and models can be included in the Appendix of the Management Report
• Management Report
• What was your analysis of the industry dynamics and the company situation
• Overall strategy for the company
• What decisions were made, how these decisions were arrived at
• Whether their decisions changed when looking at other teams’ performance, or in light of changes in macroeconomic situation
• What are the management lessons you learnt
• Conclusions
• Appendix / attachments
• The grade will be assigned based on your Management Report AND your overall profits in the simulation
